                <h2>Family History</h2>
                <p>While I was packing to get ready for my trip from Berkeley to Tabuk, my sister sent me a picture of our Keram (كيرم) board. This board is older than me and my siblings; my grandparents gifted it to my dad when he got married to my mom as one of the new home's gifts. </p>

                <p> I grew up playing this game during family and friend gatherings in parks and coffee shops. It is a game that is familar to almost everyone, even if they are not familar with its guidelines and rules. </p>
                <p> "I remember sending you this because once we started social distancing, everyone started playing (keram)," my sister said. "I feel like this game says a lot about how we appreciate commuunity gatherings even in our games.</p>

                <p> And that's exactly why I really like this game. Many of my memories about where I grew up are attached to this game, whether we were actually playing it or only the board happened to be in the background. For this website, I'll show you a very short tutorial of playing this game. But first, a quick history lesson: </p>

                <h2>Brief History</h2> 
                <p>Keram, carom, or كيرم is a game of Indian origin. It has been played in its current form for the last <a href="https://www.carrom.co.uk/history-of-carrom/"> 200 years 
                    </a> , but games with the similar concept and design have been played for thousands of years. </p>

                <p> It started becoming popular initially in South Asia, but with time, it started becoming popular in Southwest Asian and North Africa as well, making it a game that is played by people of all ages.  </p>
                
                <p> "We had (a keram board)back home. When I moved to a new place after marrying your dad, this was one of the very special, remarkable  gift we received," said my mother. "I played it when I was a child, and I play it with you now. It has grown on us as a tradition." </p>

                <p> Keram may seem confusing at first, but the instructions are very simple once you give them a shot. I will show in the next video how to play Keram, and what it is all about. </p>

                 <h2>How-to Play Keram</h2> 
                <p>What is the game about> How many people can play it? Why do the pices have different colors? I had all of these questions when I first started playing this game, and whenever I teach it to someone, they do have the same questions. </p>
                 <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/1597074163484d38f.jpg" alt="Placeholder">
                <p> Once you get to differentiate between the red piece, like the one pictured above, and the rest of the pieces, you will know which pieces to aim for during the game. This video will answer (hopefully) all your questions! </p>
